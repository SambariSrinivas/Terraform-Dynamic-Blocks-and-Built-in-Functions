# Terraform Dynamic Blocks and Built-in Functions


Terraform offers a strong set of features to help optimize your Terraform code. 
Two really useful features are 
1. Dynamic blocks, which allow you to generate static repeated blocks within resources in Terraform; 
2. Built-in functions, which help you manipulate variables and data to suit your needs and help make your Terraform deployments better automated and more fault resilient.
